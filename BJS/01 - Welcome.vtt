<v Wes>Hey folks, Wes here.</v>

2
00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:04.230
Thank you so much for checking out Beginner JavaScript.

3
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.850
I'm so excited to teach you all of this.

4
00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.700
This is all of the stuff I wish I had known

5
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.570
over the last 10 years of me doing JavaScript

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.910
so I think I'm gonna do..

7
00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.690
It's a big course but I think I'm gonna do a good job

8
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.720
at distilling it down into the things that you need to know

9
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.110
and making it easy and fun for you to know.

10
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.710
So this videos just a couple little housekeeping items

11
00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.380
before we actually get into setting anything up

12
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:27.430
and writing some code.

13
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.070
So first one is is that the starter files for this,

14
00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:32.330
you'd go to beginnerJavaScript.com,

15
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.690
click through to my account.

16
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.000
You're gonna see something like this

17
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.020
and there will be a link to the starter files.

18
00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.220
There's also a link to the Slack Channel

19
00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.380
where you can jump in that Slack Channel,

20
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.250
get help, maybe join up with a buddy

21
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.200
and do the course together something like that.

22
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.200
That's gonna bring you over to GitHub

23
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.310
and this has all of the starter files

24
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.470
as well as the solutions for this course.

25
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.158
Make sure you go ahead and hit the star on that repo.

26
00:00:57.158 --> 00:00:58.910
I see some of these repos that have

27
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.330
like a billion stars on them and I think it's because

28
00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.733
they shamelessly ask people to do it like I just did.

29
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.230
So real quick, there's kinda three folders in here.

30
00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.420
There's a snippets folder that has

31
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.570
some base HTML snippets in there

32
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.460
and I have some instructions on how

33
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.700
to get that into your editor.

34
00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.140
We'll talk about the editor in the next video.

35
00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.960
There's a playground folder and this folder will just have

36
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.030
some HTML files where when I'm trying to explain a concept,

37
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.940
I'll sorta just play around in that file.

38
00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.250
I'll often give you a dash finished file

39
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.730
and that will include what I had written in the video

40
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.430
whereas the file itself, I will either

41
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.050
ask you to create that file yourself

42
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.940
or I'll give you an empty state.

43
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.290
Finally, the exercise folder in here.

44
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.500
This contains all of the proper, full-blown exercises

45
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.160
that we are gonna be doing throughout here

46
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.140
and those are what they all have.

47
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.480
Sometimes the numbers are gonna be a little bit

48
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.670
off from what the video number is

49
00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:59.950
so just make sure you line it up

50
00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.970
with the name of the video and not the number.

51
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.060
The reason behind that is sometimes I'll scooch a video

52
00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.040
in between like "Ah, maybe we should add a video

53
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.480
on explaining this a little bit better."

54
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.620
and I'll scooch that right in and that causes

55
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.760
the numbers to get outta order.

56
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.370
So don't sweat that.

57
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.020
I think you should be able to follow that no problem.

58
00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.420
Other thing is like how should you do this course?

59
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.870
Should you watch it, should you code?

60
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.630
Should you watch-code while you watch it?

61
00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.000
From what I found is about half the people prefer

62
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.520
just to watch it, especially the playground ones.

63
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.870
Just watch me, sort of understand what it is that I'm doing

64
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.200
and then do it after and then the other half

65
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.240
prefer to do it at the exact same time.

66
00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.860
So try both of them and see sort of what makes sense for you

67
00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.060
and you'll sort of fall into what works

68
00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.173
and what feels best pretty quickly.

69
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.030
Last thing, grab a buddy if you can.

70
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.863
Jump into the--

71
00:02:53.863 --> 00:02:55.390
I know I said that I'd jump into the Slack room,

72
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.210
see if there's anybody willing to do it with you.

73
00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.590
You can team up with somebody in person

74
00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.070
so it's always better if you have somebody

75
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.310
who's an accountabilibuddy and I encourage you.

76
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.130
It's a big course, 28 hours long.

77
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.700
That's the last point I have here

78
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.950
is that you can jump around.

79
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.940
So some of you maybe come to me and say like,

80
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:15.830
Wes, I understand what functions are,

81
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.500
I know what parameters are.

82
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.390
Skip those videos then.

83
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.360
The whole idea behind this is that it's referenceable.

84
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.100
We're not building some huge app

85
00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.160
that we do every video we do a little bit.

86
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.140
Every video pretty much stands on its own

87
00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.410
and if we reference something from a past video,

88
00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.750
I'll tell you "Oh yeah we built this in a past video"

89
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.090
or "Hey, we learned about that in the last video".

90
00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.923
That's it.

91
00:03:36.923 --> 00:03:38.280
Hopefully you enjoy the course.

92
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.113
See you later.
