1
00:00:00.597 --> 00:00:03.180
(upbeat music)

2
00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.410
<v Instructor>Let's talk real quick about setup</v>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.460
and the tools that we need.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.250
You can skip this entire video,

5
00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.870
if you know the three things.

6
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.150
First, you know which browser you like to use,

7
00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.070
as well as how to open the dev tools,

8
00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.450
and how to quickly access them.

9
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.120
Two, you already have Node JS and NPM installed.

10
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.110
And three, you have an editor that you like,

11
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.690
like VS Code, something like that.

12
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.170
So, if you already have those things in place,

13
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.560
and you're comfortable with them,

14
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.320
skip this video, on to the next one.

15
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.450
I'm just going to be introducing all three of those.

16
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.500
Talking about my own choices behind them.

17
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.190
Now that's just us, let's get into browser.

18
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.300
You can use Firefox, you can use Chrome.

19
00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.050
You can actually use any browser you like for this

20
00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.210
because we're just writing JavaScript.

21
00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.260
The important thing here,

22
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.300
is that we're going to use a solid set of developer tools.

23
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.960
Now, Firefox and Chrome

24
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.850
both have very, very good developer tools.

25
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.400
I personally am going to be using

26
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.140
probably Chrome throughout the most of this,

27
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.310
but even Firefox,

28
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.180
some of the dev tools specifically around layout and CSS

29
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.910
are right now as time of recording even better

30
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.590
than some of the Chrome's out there.

31
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.420
Things you need to know how to do,

32
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.940
is how to open this dev tools here.

33
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.860
You can just right click, inspect element.

34
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.440
That's going to show you our DOM.

35
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.270
We're going to learn what the DOM is in a couple of videos.

36
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.050
And you click over to the console.

37
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.330
It's worth learning the shortcuts right now,

38
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.230
to quickly open inspect element

39
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.860
and the console really quickly.

40
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.140
That way, if you have it closed,

41
00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.950
you can just quickly,

42
00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.690
like I just hit command+shift+C on a Mac,

43
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:37.180
and I'm opening the inspect element immediately.

44
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.840
And then if I also hit option+command+J,

45
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.820
it would just immediately open the console.

46
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.980
Rather than having to do this whole song and dance.

47
00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.150
Makes me cringe you have to right click, inspect,

48
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.033
wait for it to pop up, then click on the console tab.

49
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.440
You're gonna retire early if you learn how those shortcuts.

50
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:56.273
How do you know those shortcuts?

51
00:01:56.273 --> 00:02:00.190
In Chrome, you go to view, developer

52
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.740
and then you see the shortcuts here,

53
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.950
this little funny one is option

54
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.850
'cause you have the option to take the stairs.

55
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.540
It's an escalator.

56
00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.150
This is command and then those are letters.

57
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.770
Hopefully, you know, those are.

58
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.540
In Firefox, you click on the little burger here.

59
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.980
You go to web developer.

60
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.710
And then you can click on inspector or web console.

61
00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.373
Those are the two that we specifically want.

62
00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.420
Again, memorize those.

63
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.820
I'm using it right here

64
00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.653
that you might wonder,

65
00:02:28.653 --> 00:02:30.040
"Why does it look a little bit different?"

66
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.580
This is Firefox Developer Edition,

67
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.930
it's going to get you the latest and greatest features

68
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.390
that come to both the dev tools as well as to the browser.

69
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.633
So that's the browser.

70
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.320
Next up, we need Node JS.

71
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.670
And in order to install Node JS,

72
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.960
you just go to www.nodejs.org and download.

73
00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.520
I recommend the current version.

74
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.860
Don't pay any attention to these numbers here,

75
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.100
'cause they will change

76
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.800
depending on when you're taking this course.

77
00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.960
The stuff that we're covering here

78
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.560
is not really dependent on what version you have.

79
00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.050
Because a lot of the tooling that we're using,

80
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.910
we're not actually gonna be

81
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.440
writing Node JS based websites in this course.

82
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.480
But a lot of the tooling,

83
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.920
a lot of the module bundling,

84
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.770
a lot of the code formatting,

85
00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:15.370
all of that stuff uses Node JS under the hood.

86
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.350
So we need to have that installed

87
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.770
before we go ahead and do it.

88
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:22.160
How do you how do you know if you've installed it or not?

89
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.250
Well, first, you can just try and install it again

90
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.170
and it will update you to the latest version.

91
00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.570
You can go ahead and do that.

92
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.253
And then second, you can just open up a terminal window.

93
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.210
I recommend on on Mac you can use, under your applications,

94
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.340
you see there's a utilities folder.

95
00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.810
There's this little, right here, this terminal icon

96
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.643
that we have right here.

97
00:03:44.643 --> 00:03:47.330
That's the built in one, I use one called Hyper.

98
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.500
You can use the one that's built into VS Code,

99
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.920
you can use iTerm,

100
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.320
they're all the same terminal at the end of the day.

101
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.900
And if you want to know what theme I'm using,

102
00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.840
you can go to www.wesbos.com/uses,

103
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.310
And that will give you links

104
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.243
to all of the different themes and whatnot that I'm using.

105
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:06.723
How do you know?

106
00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:08.660
Once you have a terminal open,

107
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.720
you can go ahead and just type 'node dash v'

108
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.230
and that will tell you which version you have.

109
00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.850
See, I have 10.10.10.

110
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.330
I probably could go ahead and update that myself.

111
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.610
And then you also want to check

112
00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.000
that you have npm installed.

113
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.820
So, you type 'npm dash v',

114
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.480
that'll tell you what version of npm you have installed.

115
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.020
As long as you have something greater than 10 and six,

116
00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.910
it might be version 100 by the time you watch these videos,

117
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.000
again, it doesn't matter, doesn't mean this is out of date

118
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.600
or anything like that.

119
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.910
These versions change every couple months

120
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.523
and they go up a whole version bump so don't sweat that.

121
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.660
If you're on Windows,

122
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.830
the terminal on Windows is called the Command Prompt.

123
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.980
You can go to start, all programs,

124
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.810
accessories and open up the Command Prompt.

125
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:57.710
There's also a nice little terminal called 'Cmder'

126
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.610
that I like to use on Windows.

127
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.820
If you know what WSL, Windows Subsystem Linux is,

128
00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:05.900
go ahead and use that,

129
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.480
although that has absolutely nothing to do with this course.

130
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.390
And none of the stuff

131
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.430
that you use today really depends on that.

132
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:14.400
That's totally not necessary.

133
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.650
I wanna avoid going down any rabbit holes

134
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.530
in terms of complex tooling

135
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:19.950
and best ways to do things.

136
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.250
You just need to have it installed

137
00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.633
and it's going to be working.

138
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.300
Let's just do some command line basics really quickly,

139
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:31.120
if you're not familiar with working in the command line,

140
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.900
there's a couple little commands

141
00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:33.733
that you need to know

142
00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:37.470
in order to run our JavaScript and to run our bundles.

143
00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.450
So first is 'cd'.

144
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:41.230
That means change directory.

145
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.360
If I take a look here, if you type 'ls dash l'

146
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.430
that will list out...

147
00:05:50.377 --> 00:05:51.420
all of your directories.

148
00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.187
If you're on Windows, you type 'dir'

149
00:05:53.187 --> 00:05:54.595
and that will give you a list of your directories,

150
00:05:54.595 --> 00:05:56.320
and you see I have a exercises directory,

151
00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.830
if I want to get into that I just type 'cd space exercises'.

152
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.160
And then that will put me into it.

153
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.740
You can type 'pwd'

154
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.100
and that will give you the print working directory.

155
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.050
If you ever want to know where you are somewhere,

156
00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:11.470
that will give you,

157
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.010
not all terminals are going to show you

158
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.120
this nice little thing.

159
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.880
If you want to know how to get all this setup,

160
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.650
I have a commandlinepoweruser.com.

161
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.650
Can't spell. There we go.

162
00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.840
This is a pretty quick course you can go through

163
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.920
that gets you up and running to get this cool prompt

164
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.510
that I have, again, not part of this course,

165
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.350
you can get into that.

166
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:34.527
Other things you need to know is that,

167
00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.660
if I want to go up a level of a directory,

168
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.320
See I just went into that exercise directory,

169
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.720
if I wanna go up a level, I type 'cd dot dot',

170
00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.820
and that will go up a level.

171
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:47.753
That's on both Windows and on Mac.

172
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:51.410
And that's pretty much all we need to know right now.

173
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.370
'cd' changes directory, 'pwd' tells us where we are.

174
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.170
Anything other than that,

175
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.883
we will be reviewing as we need it.

176
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.240
if you want to see if your Node is working,

177
00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.580
we already said that you can run 'node dash v',

178
00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.120
but if you just type 'node',

179
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.330
that will actually give you this little carrot here

180
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.270
and what that does is

181
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.440
it actually brings us into what's called a REPL.

182
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.212
Read, evaluate, pr— what does REPL stand for?

183
00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:26.045
REPL.

184
00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.679
Read,

185
00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:31.120
eval,

186
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.190
what does...

187
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.563
Read, evaluate, print, loop.

188
00:07:43.406 --> 00:07:44.800
Who cares what that means?

189
00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.810
Essentially, this is the console.

190
00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.460
If I were to go into my JavaScript console here

191
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.740
and type like 'one plus one' and gives you two,

192
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.590
it's the same thing here, one plus one equals two.

193
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:58.510
Sometimes people type in 'node' and then press enter

194
00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:03.310
and then they start typing things like 'ls' and 'pwb' and 'cd'

195
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.880
and it doesn't— it says like none of this is defined.

196
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.920
And it's 'cause you're confused that you're actually,

197
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.840
you're in the node console, right here, the node REPL

198
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.540
and you're not actually on the command line anymore.

199
00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:17.480
How do you get back to the command line?

200
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.830
You hit Control+C a couple times

201
00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.160
and just kind of mash your hands on the keyboard

202
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.560
a couple of times until you get back

203
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.410
to where it is that you wanted to go.

204
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:28.493
So that is node.

205
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.630
Other helpful things, Command+K or Command+R,

206
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.010
or CTRL+K, CTRL+R on Windows,

207
00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.450
that will clear out your console.

208
00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.350
Sometimes if you have a bunch of stuff here,

209
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:44.070
and you're like, "This is too much."

210
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:46.180
command+K, clear it out, nice, fresh.

211
00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.040
That's what I'm hitting if you wanna,

212
00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.670
if you ever see me just clear stuff out.

213
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:52.220
That works in in Chrome dev tools as well.

214
00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.400
I just hit command+K there

215
00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.890
and that cleared it all out for me.

216
00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.343
I find that to be helpful.

217
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.100
Finally, editor, I highly recommend

218
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.570
you use VS Code for this,

219
00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:12.220
and that's because I think

220
00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.980
it's the best editor for writing JavaScript in.

221
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.120
You may have other opinions,

222
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.430
but in terms of tooling for JavaScript,

223
00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.930
I think VS Code is the best,

224
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.230
unless you already are very good at JavaScript,

225
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:25.830
in which case, you're probably not taking this course.

226
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.480
So VS Code, we're going to be looking

227
00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.470
at some some extensions that we can use

228
00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:33.530
in order to format our JavaScript appropriately.

229
00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.450
Again, if you want to know what theme

230
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.170
or any of the extensions that I'm using,

231
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.137
please go to wesbos.com/uses

232
00:09:42.137 --> 00:09:43.310
and that will have a list

233
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.490
of all of the different software and hardware

234
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.610
and color scheme, cobalt2 color scheme, for VS Code,

235
00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:52.280
all of that stuff that I'm using,

236
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.120
if the website ever loads.

237
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.270
Other than that, that's everything we've got going on here.

238
00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:59.020
Let's jump into learning some code.
